## Working Thesis

- The archive moves from diagnosing institutional closure of knowledge systems to proposing distributed, playful, and ethically grounded knowledge publics.

## Phase 1 Evidence (Before)

1. 2021-02-20 | Reinventing the Commons (Economic and Political Weekly) | score 33.0
Quote: "The article makes a case for the reinvention of the commons in the social sciences. The individual treatment of rights reduces the collective to a mass of persons. Instead the commons acknowledges the inviolate place of humans as part of the cosmos. The marginal and dissenting imagination must invoke the poetry of nature as it engages the current politics and economics. The commons, in its diversity, seeks wisdom through a dialogue of knowledges, moving beyond traditional “publics,” and “time.”"
Why it matters: Phase 1 link: treats science as a civic commons with democratic stakes.

2. 2022-08-27 | The sadness of the university (The New Indian Express) | score 28.75
Quote: "A university is one of the great inventions of modern life. It is a theatre for ideas, a domain of play, and a commons for dissenting academics. Yet the university as a vision is in dire straits in India. As a sociologist put it, “We talk of the idea of a knowledge society as if the university is not part of it”. My friend explained it further. He said, “A university is not a place for being and becoming. It is an instrumentalist project for any group.”"
Why it matters: Phase 1 link: diagnoses how institutional science narrowed public imagination and democratic learning.

3. 2020-10-16 | Covid-19 Pandemic and the Crisis of Social Sciences (Economic and Political Weekly) | score 22.95
Quote: "This article raises wider questions like whether the social sciences have been able to provide any meaning to the Covid-19 crisis by exploring the life worlds of body, time and nature. It also focuses on the role of policy and the connectivity between social science and democracy."
Why it matters: Phase 1 link: documents closure, exhaustion, and bureaucratic drift inside knowledge systems.

4. 2017-10-11 | Proposal To Remove M From AMU, H From BHU Shows That India Doesn't Really Understand Secularism (Scroll.in) | score 22.85
Quote: "It shows little sense of the creativity of universities. The committee’s more valid critique about feudalism and inbreeding (former students making up most of its faculty) at Aligarh Muslim University can be made without any reference to secularism and would still be valid. Secondly, there is a confusion over financial and intellectual audits. The University Grants Commission panels have little sense of the creative character of these universities."
Why it matters: Phase 1 link: diagnoses how institutional science narrowed public imagination and democratic learning.

5. 2022-09-27 | Need new morals to confront banal violence (The New Indian Express) | score 21.1
Quote: "Recently, I asked a friend of mine, a major consultant in innovation systems: what are the two most innovative domains of Indian life? In a lazy way, I expected him to say IT and biotechnology. His answer caught me by surprise. “Technology is not half as innovative as social systems; corruption and violence are the two most innovative aspects of India. They threaten democracy in a way even technology cannot.” I was surprised and asked him to explain."
Why it matters: Phase 1 link: documents closure, exhaustion, and bureaucratic drift inside knowledge systems.

6. 2022-09-13 | A regime that manipulates very sense of democracy and the disquieting silence of citizenship (The New Indian Express) | score 20.25
Quote: "There is only one way to confront the fact that dissent has been the major casualty of majoritarian democracy and its urge to promote monolingual politics. To recover dissent is to reinvent democracy. There is a playfulness about dissent that dogmatic regimes cannot tolerate. It breaks the servility of dominance. This is why in folklore, the clown and the trickster were parts of the dissenting imagination. Dissent digs deep into the thought systems, into the humus of democratic thought."
Why it matters: Phase 1 link: treats science as a civic commons with democratic stakes.

## Phase 2 Evidence (After)

1. 2023-09-14 | Going beyond Big Science, embracing creative society (The New Indian Express) | score 34.1
Quote: "Recently, I came across a set of papers debating the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. I analysed 10 debates by 10 different groups. What was fascinating was that ordinary people, activists, craftsmen, and scholars had literally become knowledge panchayats, with their ideas going farther than science ever could. One group argued that information in a digital form could not create a commons of sharing."
Why it matters: Phase 2 link: recasts science as creative, experimental, and publicly co-authored.

2. 2024-09-11 | Time to look at knowledge panchayats (The New Indian Express) | score 26.95
Quote: "The other solution is the idea of a ‘knowledge panchayat’. The introduction of any policy needs a knowledge panchayat to democratise it. It is a representation of different communities, different knowledge systems that go into the making of a project. Knowledge panchayats would give a place to the housewife and the tribal in the articulation and critiquing of policy. It is clear by now that democracy must be more inventive than science if it is to survive."
Why it matters: Phase 2 link: advances distributed knowledge publics beyond expert monopolies.

3. 2023-03-22 | The necessity of knowledge panchayats (The New Indian Express) | score 26.4
Quote: "A knowledge panchayat consolidates the right to information as data with the right to knowledge as a philosophy. This makes the quality of life much better. With the knowledge panchayat, we can challenge the forced obsolescence of the people. When Covid declares old people as disposable, we can question it openly. Through knowledge panchayats, we can enter the epic debates on biotechnology, artificial intelligence, quantum physics and cybernetics."
Why it matters: Phase 2 link: advances distributed knowledge publics beyond expert monopolies.

4. 2023-11-07 | India needs to imagine a new peace (The New Indian Express) | score 23.0
Quote: "There are fascinating experiments that need wider publicity and discussion. The Buddhist imagination which has reworked the idea of compassion must be debated. Even Stanford University has initiated a course on compassionate economics. The Dalai Lama has been working with MIT and Harvard to create a truly non-violent science, collaborating with exemplars such as Matthieu Ricard, Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana."
Why it matters: Phase 2 link: recasts science as creative, experimental, and publicly co-authored.

5. 2025-02-25 | How to frame everyday ethics for the new era (The New Indian Express) | score 22.85
Quote: "Philosophers have suggested four criterions for modern ethics. It should be a general-purpose activity that can feed our expertise, but can no longer be dependent on it. It has to be innovative to consider sticking to older models; school books will not do. Jesuit schools had created moral science and socially-useful productive work textbooks that discussed these questions. Ethics should go back, playfully discuss and reclaim these efforts of pedagogy."
Why it matters: Phase 2 link: grounds knowledge politics in ethics, conscience, and social repair.

6. 2024-02-13 | A professor who championed playful plurality (The New Indian Express) | score 22.0
Quote: "Jit claimed that Gandhi, like Jagadish Chandra Bose, was involved in science. He added that it was inconsequential that Gandhi called his autobiography My Experiments with Truth . Jit argued that life is always an experiment, and the experiment is never on the other. An experiment on the other would be an act of vivisection, like the British vivisected India, indifferent to the power and imagination of the body and the body politic."
Why it matters: Phase 2 link: recasts science as creative, experimental, and publicly co-authored.
